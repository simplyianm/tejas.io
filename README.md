Hi, I'm Tejas Manohar and this is the source code for my personal website, [http://tejas.io](http://tejas.io). Feel free to browse the source, fork at will, and [ask me questions](http://twitter.com/tejasmanohar). Sharing is caring!


## Design

If you decided to fork, please create your own blog design, don't use mine. I don't want to see fifty other sites that look the same as mine. Thanks for understanding!
